# Assignment Title: Full Stack Junior Developer - Library Management System

## Assignment Description:

In this assignment, you will be tasked with developing a Library Management System for a college. The system should allow users to manage books, and borrowing transactions. You will be using Next.js and Tailwind/Chakra UI for the frontend, and Express or NestJS for the backend. The data should be stored in a SQL database. The assignment will assess your ability to design and implement a full-stack application, work with frontend frameworks, handle database operations, and create REST APIs.

## Instructions:

1. Fork this project repo to your profile and clone it to work on the project.

2. Design and implement a Library Management System that provides functionality for managing books, borrowers, and borrowing transactions.

3. The application should have the following functionality:

   - Book Management: Admin should be able to add new books, update existing books, delete books, and retrieve book information. Each book should have attributes such as title, author, ISBN, publication date, and availability status.

   - Borrowing Transactions: Admin should be able to create new borrowing transactions, update existing transactions, delete transactions, and retrieve transaction details. Each transaction should include, the book borrowed, the borrowing date, and the due date.

4. Use Next.js and Tailwind/Chakra UI to build the frontend of the application. Implement responsive and user-friendly interfaces to allow users to interact with the system easily.

5. Use Express or NestJS to build the backend of the application. Implement REST APIs to handle the CRUD operations for books, and borrowing transactions.

6. Use a SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for data storage. Design the database schema to store the necessary information for books, borrowers, and transactions. Implement efficient database operations and query strategies to ensure optimal performance.

7. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the application. Admin should be able to register, log in, and log out. Only authenticated admin should be able to perform actions.

8. Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code. Follow best practices for code organization, naming conventions, and code formatting.

9. Use Git for version control and commit your code regularly to the forked public Git repository in your profile.

### Bonus Points:

- Implement input validation and error handling for the frontend and backend components.
- Implement pagination or filtering options for retrieving book, or transaction data.
- Implement unit tests or integration tests to ensure the correctness of your code.
- Implement data seeding or migration scripts for setting up and populating the database.
- Implement additional features that enhance the usability or functionality of the Library Management System.
